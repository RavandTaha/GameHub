# GameHub

Hello;)

Welcome to the report of Gamehub, i will talk about how I made Gamehub with CSS and HTML, and what I've learned so far from this project.

The goal with this project was to make Gamehub similar as Figma prototype as possible.

while I was working with designing the css according Figma prototype, I found out that it will be hard. When I made the figma prototype my goal was to make it look as beautiful as I could. I learned now that I made it very difficult for me. A nice looking page with alot of contect means more HTML and CSS. For a newbie like me, its hard coding so good looking website. Some small details like font size, font-weight and posistions are changed from figma desgin to fit for all screen sizes.

CSS | HTML

All of coding is made with CSS, HTML and Javescript on VS Code.

I made CSS file for every HTML site beacuse I mean its more clear/clean. This way, it was easier for me to design all the pages different. I used CSS code which I learned from Noroff modules and Youtube. I got alot of help from discord also. All code written in this project is from Modules/Youtube and Discord.

I have never before done any project with HTML and CSS, this is the first time learning and working with HTML and CSS. I learned alot from modules and youtube tutorials. I learned through building that a responsive website is very importanted for every screen size. I struggled alot with designing the website, but I'm glad for what I have accomplished. I have gained a much better understanding of HTML and CSS, and I gained some confidence in my ability to create websites from scratch.

The biggest issue I had was making sure that the website was readable and responsive with all screen sizes. I had to use media queries and change width, height and font sizes to make it resposive.
