A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

The goal with this project was to make Gamehub similar as Figma prototype as possible.
All of coding is made with CSS, HTML and Javescript on VS Code.

I made CSS file for every HTML site beacuse I mean its more clear/clean. This way, it was easier for me to design all the pages different. I used CSS code which I learned from Noroff modules and Youtube. I got alot of help from discord also. All code written in this project is from Modules/Youtube and Discord.

Gamehub is a website for all gamers to get their favorite games for low cost or free. Gamehub offers free games and paid games. Nice and simple navigation for users through the web, and phone version. The website is aimed at the age group 12-25 years old

Homepage (index.html) is the homepage for Gamehub. Where u can see what Gamehub is about and easy menu to find most popular/latest release games.

At the end of the page you can susbscribe to Gamehub's newsletter and naviagte through our different pages.

With the header and footer menu, you can navigate throught Gamehub's category, cart, and contact us page easily.

At Gamehub we have our own delivery, shipping info and product page.
